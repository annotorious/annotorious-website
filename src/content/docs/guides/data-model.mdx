title: Annotation Data Model
---

At the core of Annotorious is a flexible data model that closely 
aligns with the [W3C Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/), 
but with a few key differences to optimize for performance and 
ease of use.

## Anatomy of an Annotation

Every annotation in Annotorious is represented by a JavaScript 
object with the following structure:

```js
{
  id: '7fb76422-3a8c-4c87-bbad-7c8bb68399a0',
  target: {
    selector: {
      type: 'RECTANGLE',
      geometry: {
        bounds: {
            minX: 272,
            minY: 169,
            maxX: 393,
            maxY: 259
        },
        x: 272,
        y: 169,
        w: 121,
        h: 90,
      }
    }
  }
}
```

* `id` - a unique identifier for the annotation. The ID can be any 
  alphanumeric string. If you provide an Annotation without an ID, 
  Annotorious will automatically assign a globally unique UUID on load.
  Annotations created by users will also receive a UUID 
  automatically.

* `target` - the target object represents the part of the image 
  that the annotation is associated with. In this example, the 
  `selector` property specifies that the annotation is a 
  rectangular selection with the given coordinates and dimensions.

* `bounds` - represents the bounding box of the annotation, useful 
  for quick calculations without parsing the entire geometry.

Here's another example for a polygon annotation, where the 
`geometry` object contains a list of X/Y points.

```js 
{
  id: '64d7dda8-c156-4e1e-a4f9-55192399208b',
  target: {
    selector: {
      type: 'POLYGON',
      geometry: {
        bounds: {
          minX: 60,
          minY: 88,
          maxX: 248,
          maxY: 223
        },
        points: [
          [60, 221],
          [136, 88],
          [248, 148],
          [172, 223]
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Annotation Bodies

In addition to the `target`, annotations can also have one or more 
`bodies`. The `bodies` property is designed to carry application-specific
annotation payload, such as comments, tags, or other metadata.

It's important to note that Annotorious doesn't process or display 
body information directly. Instead, bodies serve as an extensible 
data structure that you can use according to your application's
needs, e.g. to drive info popups, hover tooltips, or data-driven 
filters and styles.

```js
{
  id: '64d7dda8-c156-4e1e-a4f9-55192399208b',
  bodies: [{
    id: '3f4d0a8c-803a-4e59-ad0b-20c82d87c815',
    purpose: 'commenting',
    value: 'This is a comment'
  }],
  target: { 
    // ...
  }
}
```

The structure of bodies in Annotorious is closely aligned with 
the W3C Web Annotation Data Model, with a few small differences 
and simplifications.

- `id`: any alphanumeric string. If you provide a body without an 
  ID, Annotorious will automatically assign a UUID on load.
- `purpose`: used [similarly to the W3C model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#motivation-and-purpose),
  identifying the reason for the inclusion of the body in the annotation.
- `value`: a generic field that you can use according to your 
  application's needs.

Other optional fields include:

- `creator`: the user who created the body.
- `created`: the creation timestamp of the body.
- `updatedBy`: the user who last updated the body.
- `updated`: stores the last update timestamp of the body.

### Leveraging Bodies in Your Application

While Annotorious provides the structure for the bodies, it's up 
to you as the developer to decide how to use them. 

Here are some ways to leverage annotation bodies:

1. __Custom popups:__ display body information when users 
  interact with annotations. This could include showing comments, 
  tags or metadata in a tooltip or sidebar.
2. __Data-driven styles:__ use body properties to dynamically style 
   annotations. For example:
   * Apply difference styles based on the `purpose`, e.g. different 
     colors for `commenting` vs `tagging`.
   * Use the `value` of `tagging` bodies to color-code annotations
     based on label values.
3. __Data-driven filters:__ filter annotations dynamically, based 
   on body properties such as `purpose`, `creator` or `updated` 
   timestamp. 
4. __Application-Specific Metadata:__ store any additional 
   metadata your application needs in the value field, or by
   adding your own properties to the body object.

Annotorious provides a number of helpers and utility functions 
to simplify these scenarios. To read more, see documentation on:

## Key Differences from the W3C Model

While the Annotorious model shares similarities with the W3C Web 
Annotation Data Model, there are key differences designed to 
enhance performance and simplify usage when building web applications:

1. __Simplified Structure:__ Annotorious makes no claim to support 
   the full range of the extensive W3C Web Annotation standard. 
   Annotorious streamlines the annotation structure to focus on the 
   essential elements that it implements, while staying close enough
   to the W3C model to make crosswalking as easy as possible.

2. __Optimized for Performance:__ the model prioritizes performance 
   by having explicit representations for shape geometry, thus avoiding 
   the need to repeatedly parse and serialize the selectors from and to 
   the W3C model's string-based representations. For example, Annotorious
   uses direct coordinate values instead of SVG path strings, allowing 
   for faster rendering and manipulation of annotations.

3. __Ease of Use:__ Annotorious aims to be intuitive and easy to use, 
   with a focus on providing a smooth developer experience. Whereas 
   the W3C model is designed to be more general-purpose, Annotorious' 
   restricted use case allows it to make certain assumptions and 
   simplifications.

## The W3C Adapter

Despite the differences, Annotorious also provides a built-in feature 
that allows you to use W3C Web annotations directly, through a 
component called the `W3CImageAdapter`.

The `W3CImageAdapter` automatically crosswalks annotations between 
the W3C- and the native model, allowing you to use the Annotorious 
API while still adhering to the W3C standard. Through the adapter, 
Annotorious offers the best of both worlds - the performance and 
ease of use of its native data model, with the flexibility to conform 
to the W3C standard when needed.

```js
import { createImageAnnotator, W3CImageAdapter } from '@annotorious/annotorious';

import '@annotorious/annotorious/annotorious.css';

const anno = createImageAnnotator('sample-image', { 
  adapter: W3CImageAdapter('sample-image')
});
```
