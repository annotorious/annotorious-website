Annotorious is a JavaScript library for adding image annotation 
capabilities to your web application. Try it out below: __click__ or 
__tap__ the annotation to edit. __Click or tap anywhere and drag__
to create a new annotation.

<ImageExample client:only="react" />

Use the buttons to switch between rectangle and polygon drawing modes. To 
close a polygon shape, __click or tap__ the first polygon point again.

## OpenSeadragon

Annotorious integrates seamlessly with [OpenSeadragon](https://openseadragon.github.io), 
allowing you to annotate high-resolution zoomable images, including images 
served via [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) (International Image Interoperability Framework). 
Try it out below: use the buttons to switch between moving the image (zooming, panning) and annotating. 

Start an annotation with a __single mouse click__. On a touch device, start 
the annotation with a __drag gesture__. If you are __not__ on a touch device, 
you can still drag or zoom the image while annotating. 

When drawing a rectangle, __a second mouse click__ completes it. On a touch device, 
the rectangle will be completed by simply lifting your finger. When drawing a polygon, 
__a single click or tap__ adds a point. To close the polygon, __click or tap the first point again__.

## JavaScript API

The Annotorious JavaScript API gives you programmatic control over 
annotations, enables you to customize behavior and visual styling, and
integrate Annotorious with the rest of your application. 

With the API, you can:

- add, remove or update annotations programmatically
- listen to user events
- set filters
- apply data-driven styles, etc.

## Using Annotorious

You can use Annotorious in your project in several ways depending
on your preferred JavaScript framework. Annotorious supports vanilla 
JavaScript, and provides bindings for [React](https://react.dev/). 
Bindings for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) are currently under development.
