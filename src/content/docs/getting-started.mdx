Annotorious is a JavaScript library for adding image annotation 
capabilities to your web application. Try it out below: __click__ or 
__tap__ the annotation to edit. __Click or tap anywhere and drag__
to create a new annotation.

<ImageExample client:only="react" />

Use the buttons to switch between rectangle and polygon drawing modes. To 
close a polygon shape, __double click with your mouse__, or 
__keep your finger on the screen and hold for a moment__ on 
a touch device.

## OpenSeadragon

Annotorious integrates seamlessly with [OpenSeadragon](https://openseadragon.github.io), 
allowing you to annotate high-resolution zoomable images. Try it out below:
use the buttons to switch between moving the image (zooming, panning) and
annotating. 

Start an annotation with a __single click or tap__. You can still
drag or zoom the image while annotating. When drawing a rectangle, a 
__second click or tap__ completes it. When drawing a polygon, __a single
click or tap__ adds a point. To close the polygon, __double click__
or __keep your finger on the screen and hold for a moment__ on a 
touch device.

## JavaScript API

The Annotorious JavaScript API gives you programmatic control over 
annotations, enables you to customize behavior and visual styling, and
integrate Annotorious with the rest of your application. 

With the API, you can:

- add, remove or update annotations programmatically
- listen to user events
- set filters
- apply data-driven styles, etc.

## Using Annotorious

You can use Annotorious into your project in several ways depending
on your preferred JavaScript framework. Annotorious supports vanilla 
JavaScript, and provides bindings for [React](https://react.dev/). 
Bindings for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) are currently under development.
